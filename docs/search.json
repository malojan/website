    "text": "I am Malo Jan, a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the Center for European Studies and Comparative Politics at Sciences Po Paris, under the supervision of Emiliano Grossman. I hold a research master’s degree in Political Science from Sciences Po Paris, where I wrote my master’s thesis on French MPs’ responses to climate change. From January 2024 to June 2024, I will be a visiting researcher at the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford.\nMy primary research interests lie in political elites and climate politics. My dissertation focuses on political polarization around climate change in Western Europe. Specifically, I examine how opposition discourses to climate policies influence party competition on climate change, citizens’ attitudes, and electoral behavior.\nSince beginning my master’s degree, I have also developed a strong interest in computational social sciences. I use these methods in my research to collect online data and create new measures of political concepts in large text corpora. Additionally, I teach these methods, alongside classical quantitative methods and introduction to programming for social scientists, at Sciences Po Paris."
