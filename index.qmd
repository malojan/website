I am Malo Jan, a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the [Center for European Studies and Comparative Politics](https://www.sciencespo.fr/centre-etudes-europeennes/en/) at Sciences Po Paris, under the supervision of Emiliano Grossman. I hold a research master's degree in Political Science from Sciences Po Paris, where I wrote my master's thesis on French MPs' responses to climate change. 

My primary research interests lie in political elites and climate politics. My dissertation focuses on political polarization around climate change in Western Europe. Specifically, I look at how opposition discourses to climate policies influence party competition on climate change, citizens' attitudes, and electoral behavior.

Since beginning my master's degree, I have also developed a strong interest in computational social sciences. I use these methods in my research to collect online data and create new measures of political concepts in large text corpora. Additionally, I teach these methods, alongside classical quantitative methods and introduction to programming for social scientists, at Sciences Po Paris.
